# Stock_Closing_Price_Prediction
This project uses Python to predict stock closing prices through data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning models. The notebook demonstrates how historical stock data can be leveraged to build predictive models and evaluate their performance. It serves as a hands-on implementation of data science techniques in financial forecasting.
